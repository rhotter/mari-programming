# Introduction to Programming with JavaScript

## Introduction to Variables
### What is a variable?

### Using Variables
* **Declaring a variable:** `var numApples`
* **Assigning to a variable:** `numApples = 2;`

## Functions with Parameters
Until now, we haven't put anything inside the brackets when we call on a function. Now, we can add **paramaters** inside the brackets. Parameters allow our function to take input.

*Example 5.2.4 in CodeHS: Area of Triangle*
```javascript
function area_of_triangle(base,height) {
  var area = base*height/2;
  println(area);
}
```

## Graphics and Object-Oriented Programming
Objects have properties and methods.
